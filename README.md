1st Draft of Project 2

Attached above is the fasta file that was obtained from the Uniprot of FGF2. 
Scientific Question: How does changing levels (or mutating) of FGF2 affect the activation of Ras-ERK and PLC pathways in cancer? 
Hypothesis: If FGF-2 concentrations exceed maximum levels for stimulating the activation of the Ras-ERK and PLC pathways, 
then there will be down regulation of the signaling transduction of both the Ras-ERK and PLC pathways.
